# IAC - Infrastructure as code

## What is IAC exactly?
- IAC is a DevOps technique to define your infrastructure in a code like we write code in different programming languages.
- It is a modern technique.
- The rise of these domains will be critical for managing cloud resources on the console. Go to the console, log in, create resources, or from CLI also.
- We can define it in a code and a tool like Pulumi is setting up our infrastructure very fastly.

## What are the other IAC tools?
- Terraform
- AWS CloudFormation

## Why Pulumi?
- Compared to other IAC tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation they have to define in their own new language like for TF there is HCL.
- Or if not then we can use YAML or JSON format.
- `Pulumi` is a tool that can define the Infrastructure using our favorite programming language. EX. Python, Java, Go, JS.
- It'll benefit for the developers not to learn the new programming language, They can use their own custom.
